Goal: A player wins when they capture all of their opponent's pieces.

Equipment: A 13 space slanted or diagonal square board is used. 
		   Each player has 10 pieces each.
		   One plays the black pieces, and the other plays the white pieces.

Game Play and Rules:
	1.Players decide what colors to play, and who starts first.
	2.Players initially place four of their pieces on the four squares nearest them and to their right.
	  Each player's remaining six pieces are set aside next to the board.
	3.Players alternate their turns. Only one piece may be moved or used to capture an enemy piece per turn.
	4.A piece moves one space per turn orthogonally along the slanted or diagonal square board onto a vacant space.
	5.A player's piece can capture an enemy piece by the short leap.
	  The player's piece must be adjacent to the enemy piece, and land on a vacant space on the other side.
	  The capture must be done in an orthogonal direction following the slanted or diagonal design of the board.
	  Only one enemy piece can be captured per turn. A captured piece is removed from the board.
	6.If a player's piece has been captured,
	  then the player at the beginning of their next turn must take one piece from their reserve,
	  and drop it on any vacant space.
	  A player's number of pieces on the board must always be restored to four,
	  unless of course the player has exhausted their reserve. Please note though,
	  that a player can only drop a piece from their reserve,
	  if one of their pieces was captured on the opponent's last turn.
